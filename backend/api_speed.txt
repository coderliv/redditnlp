# this is without implementing concurrency 
to sample 100 posts, it takes less than a minute (~45 seconds)
to sample 200 posts, it takes less than 2 minutes (~1 minute 45 seconds)
200 posts = ~ 75,000 words (that's a lot of text to work with!)

# after implementing concurrency with asyncio:
can sample 400 posts with their comments in ~ 40 seconds 
400 posts with their comments is ~ 140,000 words
